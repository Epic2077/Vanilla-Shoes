## üöÄ Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Epic2077/Vanilla-Shoes.git
   cd Vanilla-Shoes
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the App**:
   Use a development server to serve the app locally. You may use a server of your choice, such as `lite-server`, `live-server`, `webpack dev server`, or as I use `vite`
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Install Back-end**:
   The back-end of the website is stored in another repo called [Vanilla-Shoes-back-end](#). It contains the api and JSON needed for the project to be fetched using `JSON-server`.

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Epic2077/Vanilla-Shoes-back-end.git
    cd Vanilla-Shoes-back-end
   ```

   Then install the dependencies.

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

   Now you can start the `JSON-server`.

   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

   **Make Sure the local address of your server and `JSON-server` is different!**
